The Plots
============

VAMPzero provides a number of standard plots that help with interpreting the results. 
The plots are available as \*\.pdf files in the *./ReturnDirectory*. 

Apart from the geometry there are plots available for breakdowns of the drag as well as 
the weight breakdowns. Additionally the payload range diagram is computed here. For the 
future we want to include further information such as a weight-balance sheet and a v-n diagramm

You can find some more information for the repective plots in the following sections:
