Results
=======

This section will give an outline on the results calculated by VAMPzero and their interpretation. 
First of all, it should be noted that VAMPzero is a simple sizing tool. There is no optimization 
carried out and for the tool to succeed it might take many iterations. There must no necessarily be 
a converging solution for the input parameters you specified, so make sure to check the log file 
every time.

If however your calculation runs into convergence you can have a look at several interpretations for 
the results. In the following section theses results will be discussed.
