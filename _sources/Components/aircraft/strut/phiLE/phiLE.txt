.. _strut.phiLE:

Parameter: phiLE
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    The sweep angle of the strut at the 50% chord line. Currently, there are
    two simplifications included in the strut model:

    * The strut is not tapered and hence all sweep angles are identical
    * The value of this parameter is identical to the 25% chord sweep angle

    The angle of sweep which characterizes a swept wing is
    conventionally measured along the 25% chord line. If
    the 25% chord line varies in sweep angle, the leading edge is used;
    if that varies, the sweep is expressed in sections (e.g., 25 degrees
    from 0 to 50% span, 15 degrees from 50% to wingtip).
