.. _strut.aspectRatio:

Parameter: aspectRatio
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    In aerodynamics, the aspect ratio of a wing is essentially the ratio of its length to its breadth (chord). 
    A high aspect ratio indicates long, narrow wings, whereas a low aspect ratio indicates short, stubby wings.
    For most wings the length of the chord is not a a constant but varies along the wing, so the aspect ratio AR 
    is defined as the square of the wingspan b divided by the area refArea of the wing planform - this is equal to 
    the length-to-breadth ratio for constant breadth.

    This parameter describes the aspectRatio for the strut. Currently, the taperRatio of the strut is assumes to
    equal one, hence only simple calculations are included here.
