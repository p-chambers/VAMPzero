.. _strut.phi25:

Parameter: phi25
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    The sweep angle of the strut at the 25% chord line. Currently, there are
    two simplifications included in the strut model:

    * The strut is not tapered and hence all sweep angles are identical
    * This parameter may be set as user input.
      All other sweep angles of the strut read their values from here

    The angle of sweep which characterizes a swept wing is
    conventionally measured along the 25% chord line. If 
    the 25% chord line varies in sweep angle, the leading edge is used; 
    if that varies, the sweep is expressed in sections (e.g., 25 degrees 
    from 0 to 50% span, 15 degrees from 50% to wingtip).
