Overview

VAMPzero is a conceptual aircraft design tool that is quick and easy to use. It is based on well-known handbook 
methods, object-oriented and easily extendible. The tool enables the user to trace the calculation history and export data to CPACS.   
It is written by Daniel Boehnke at the German Aerospace Center (DLR e.V.) and licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.
