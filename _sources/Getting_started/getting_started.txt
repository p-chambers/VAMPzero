Getting Started
***************

In this section you will get a quick start into VAMPzero. 
The following pages will lead you through the complete process 
for downloading, installing and running VAMPzero. 


Download
================
There are currently two versions of VAMPzero available. The first one is compliled and comes
along with a small graphical user interface. It is probably the better one if you just want to
have a quick look at it.

The second version comes as source code and can be run from any Python console. If you are interested
in looking at the code, including your own equations and factors, this is probably the right place for you.

Binary Version
================
If you have downloaded the .zip file from the link above you only
need to **unzip** it to a folder of your choice. We have tested the binary version of VAMPzero on Windows XP, 7 (both 32 and 64bit).

To run VAMPzero through the graphical user interface you just
need to execute the **VAMPzero.bat** file in the folder you unzipped. 
If you have Java installed and the downloaded files are not coruppted,
a commandline prompt as well as the graphical user interface will open.

The first thing to do is, loading a prepared input file via the **Load configuration** button
on the upper right. Try to load the toolInput.xml file, that can be found in the ToolInput folder 
in the directory where you unzipped VAMPzero.

A number of components, disciplines and parameters will be loaded, so that the graphical
user interface now displays some values. You can at a later point change these values but 
for now you can continue with pressing **Create CPACS**.
   
The graphical user interface will now create a new *./ToolInput/toolInput.xml* file and trigger VAMPzero.


Source Code
================
Currently, VAMPzero is provided as a scripted version. So you should be familiar at least to some extend to
Python programming. VAMPzero runs on **Python 2.6** so this should be installed on your computer along with
the **setuptools**. I have not encountered any issues with Python 2.7 as well. The installer will load missing 
packages.

Now open a console and browse to the folder where you have unzipped VAMPzero. Type::

   python setup.py install


VAMPzero will now register itself with your Python distribution. For a simple start you can try to run the
delivered script::

   python VAMPzero.py


Output
===============

In the commandline prompt you will see the calculation running. VAMPzero displays all values read, the calculation
history for each iteration and will finally print a list of all calculated results. The last lines in the output window should
read something like:: 

	##############################################################################
                                        VAMPzero
                                        FINISHED
                                   15.06 seconds passed
	##############################################################################
	##############################################################################
	
If you can read this message there is a good chance that your first calculation run was successful. For more information on the calculation 
run you can look into :ref:`logfile` . You can now proceed to one of the following sections. 
There is information on handling the results generated by VAMPzero as well as some more information
on how to manipulate the input data.

Moving on
