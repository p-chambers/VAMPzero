Development
***********

If you are interested in a development version of VAMPzero, 
want to contribute to the code, 
or just have a look at it, please feel free to contact me. 

At a later point in time VAMPzero source code will be available anonymously, 
currently we are still working on too many open items 
to grant access to everyone. 

A list of things to be done can be found in the :ref:`todolist` section. 

Anyway, we will be happy to help!
