Knowledge Base
==============

As already outlined, one of the requirements for a conceptual
design module is closing the gap between TLAR and a dataset
sufficient enough to trigger higher level methods. An increase
in information is equivalent to a transfer from a system
with lower dimensionality to a system with more dimensions.
Hence this can only be carried out using additional (design)
knowledge. By utilizing techniques from KBE this process
can be coded and automated.
For the purposes of this project it was important to generate
the parametric geometry description as defined by CPACS out
of the reduced parameter set of the conceptual design module.
As we are currently focussing on civil jet transport,
a sufficient database to retrieve rules for a KBE approach
is available. Additionally, data generated by VAMPzero,
mainly mass distributions, moments of intertia, as well as
tool-specific data are transfered to CPACS. Thereby product
and process knowledge are used.

An example for a cpacsExport method that was implemented
to the wing component can be seen in Figure 8. As the horizontal
and vertical tail inherit the wing component, the same
methods can be applied easily. The upward change in level
of detail can only be realized by applying knowledge-based
rules and hence this process should usually be monitored by
an engineer-in-the-loop.

Both CPACS and VAMPzero are coded in object-oriented
languages. Although CPACS is more a schema definition
than tool it was possible to extract libraries from this definition
that allowed for easy handling of objects. Generating
CPACS-like objects and exporting them in the correct syntax
is therefore integrated in VAMPzero without implementing
additional code fragments.

Geometry Generation
-------------------

Wing
^^^^
The calculation methods within VAMPzero define a simple trapezoid wing.
To extend the output geometry VAMPzero can produce several wing structures via similarity transformation.
Due to the value of the wings 'LoD' parameter one of the following geometries will be exported:

* 'N'   - no geometry
* 'T'   - the trapezoid wing
* 'DT'  - a double trapezoid wing
* 'ADT' - an advanced double trapezoid wing
* 'UCAV'- a geometry of an unmanned combat air vehicle 

As said, the generation of advanced wing geometries needs additional information.
To assure the similarity between the trapezoid wing within VAMPzero and the generated advanced wing geometry, the dimensionless numbers will be kept constant during the transformation.
The dimensionless numbers kept from the original trapezoid wing are the following:

#. Lambda - the aspect ratio
#. tau_f - the taper ratio
#. phi - the sweep angle of the leading edge
#. psi - the dihedral 

The reference area is used for dimensioning the wing.
Details on the geometry generation can be found in [...].

Fuselage
^^^^^^^^
For the generation of a complex fuselage geometry, a database is used. 
At the moment there is only one complex fuselage geometry to choose from, but there will be more geometries available in the future.
The geometries for the nose, middle and tail can be chosen individually.
